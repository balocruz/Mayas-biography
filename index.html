        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p>
          She was born on the 27th of november, a date that quietly marks the begining of a story still unfolding. Growing u in Nairobi, She has always been sorrounded by movement, and contrast - a city that never truly sleeps and never stops shaping the people who live in it.
          <br>
          <br>
          She currently lives in Kileleshwa, a place that mirrors her balance between calm and ambition. It's a place where reflection meets forward motion, much like her own journey, but a backdrop to her growth,lessons, and evolving dreams.
          <br>
          <br>
          Her academic journey is something she carries with pride. She completed her high school education at <strong>Ngala Memorial Girls High School</strong>,finishing a chapter that demanded discipline, resilience, and focus. Those years played a major role in shaping her character -strengthening her independence and sharpening her sense of purpose.
          <br>
          <br>
          While not every detail of her early years is written down, what stands out most is her steady progress forward. She is someone still discovering who she is becoming, guided by curiosity, determination, and a quiet confidence. Her story isn't finished - in fact it's only just the begining.
